# NarouReader

NarouReader is an application designed to read "Narou" novels using the Narou API. This project serves as a personal learning experience and is intended for self-satisfaction. While there is a future goal to release it on the App Store, this may take some time due to the cost of a developer account. Note that the app has not been tested on Android devices, so its functionality on such devices is not guaranteed.
